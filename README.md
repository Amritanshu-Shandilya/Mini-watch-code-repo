# Mini-watch-code-repo
A repository that holds all the main.cpp files of the main Mini-watch project. This would help for maintaining a devlog as well as for maintaing a log of the code for some other uses.

For more context or to know more about each code file, join my discord server and see the devlog.
[Devlog Channel](https://discordapp.com/channels/1117152456330190920/1124764059540144213)

Note that the code may or may not have same numbers as the devlogs in the channel so please try to find the development log with relevant headings. I will keep the title of the devlog entry and name of the related code file same.
